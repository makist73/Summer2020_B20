Variables: makes the data reusable

        declare variables:
            DataType  variableName = Data;(semicolon)


 			double a = 0.3;
            double TaxRate =0.3;

            rules for variable name:  MUST be readable & meanigful
                            1.  MUST be unique( cannot be duplicated)
                            2.  needs to start with letters
                            3.  cannot contain any special characters other than $ and _
                            4.  cannot be java reserved word
                            5.  if variable name contains more than one word, we apply camelCase

                            $num

 primitive datatypes:(8 of them) byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean

        for numbers:  byte, short, int, long, float, double
            for whole number (ONLY): byte, short, int, long  (int is prefered by compiler)
                        0, 1, 2,3,4,5....

            for decimal number: float, double  (double is prefered by compiler )
                    2.5, 3.5 ....

            double > float > long > int > short > byte

            large primitive CANNOT be assigned to smaller primitive
            smaller primitive CAN be assigned to larger primitives

-----------------------------------
local variables: variables that are declared within the block or methods
                MUST be initialized before use


=: assignment operator
    used for initializing values to variables


boolean: expression of true or false
        MUST be evaluted to true or false

 char: used for single character. character MUST be given in a single quote

           char ch1 = '1';
   EVERY SINGLE CHARS HAS ITS OWN CORRESPONDING NUMBER

           char ch2 = 65;

           'A' + 2 ==> 67
           int num = 'A';   ==> 65


int: Integer numbers
double: decimal numbers
boolean: true/false
char: single characters, ''

String: sequence of characters, string of text. must be given in ""
        NOT A PRIMITIVE
 + with String: concates and returns the string

                        any data can be concated to a string

"123"+1 ==>1231
123 + 1 ==> 124

Concatenation VS Addition:

      number + number ==> addition

      text + number ==> concatenation


concatenation: append
    "Hello" + 123 ==> Hello123
    "12" + 13 ==> 1213
